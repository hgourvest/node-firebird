# Node-Firebird Roadmap

This document outlines the future development direction for the `node-firebird` library. Our primary goals are to modernize the codebase, implement support for the latest Firebird features, and improve the overall developer experience. A major milestone landed in v2.4.0: the codebase was migrated to TypeScript 7 (see section 3), and Firebird 6.0-era protocol features (SRP-256/384/512, ChaCha wire encryption, database events) shipped alongside it.

> **Note:** The issue and PR lists below may be incomplete. Please check the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/hgourvest/node-firebird/issues) for the most up-to-date list of open items, and feel free to open new issues or add a 👍 to existing ones to help prioritize.

---

## Guiding Principles

- **Stability first:** fix hangs, leaks, and "callback never called" scenarios before adding new API surface.
- **Compatibility:** keep the current callback API stable while adding promise/TypeScript improvements.
- **Framework-friendly:** make it straightforward to use in web frameworks (Express, Fastify, etc.) without connection leaks.
- **Incremental delivery:** ship small, reviewable changes rather than large rewrites.

---

## 1. User-Reported Issues (Prioritized)

These items come directly from current open issues and should be tracked as roadmap deliverables. Priority is based on user impact and frequency of reports.

### P0 — Correctness / hang / callback never called

- **[Issue #387](https://github.com/hgourvest/node-firebird/issues/387) — BLOB callback never runs** ✅ Resolved
  Goal: ensure query callbacks always settle (success or error) and that BLOB streaming cannot stall silently.
  Deliverables:
  - Add internal watchdog/timeout for pending requests (opt-in first, then default).
  - Add debug logging hooks (connection + statement lifecycle) to diagnose stalls.
  - Add regression test: BLOB read path must either resolve or error deterministically.

- **[Issue #357](https://github.com/hgourvest/node-firebird/issues/357) — Pool connections hanging after idle time** ✅ Resolved
  Goal: pool should detect dead sockets and recover cleanly.
  Deliverables:
  - Health-check on checkout (lightweight ping or keepalive).
  - Better handling of server disconnects + reconnect backoff.
  - Ensure `db.detach()` always returns connection to pool in all code paths.

- **[Issue #343](https://github.com/hgourvest/node-firebird/issues/343) — Pool connection errors**
  Goal: pool should provide reliable acquisition and clear error messages.
  Deliverables:
  - Clarify pool error semantics and add a retry strategy option.
  - Add tests for pool exhaustion and stale idle connections.

- **[Issue #313](https://github.com/hgourvest/node-firebird/issues/313) — Sequential heap limit / allocation failed**
  Goal: reduce memory pressure and document safe usage patterns.
  Deliverables:
  - Validate that `sequentially` does not retain rows unintentionally. ✅ Covered by existing regression test (`test/index.js` — "should not buffer all streamed rows in sequentially callback result").
  - Provide streaming patterns and "do/don't" guidance in docs. ✅ Added — see [README.md § Streaming a big data](README.md#streaming-a-big-data), including a backpressure example using the `on(row, index, next)` / Promise form.

### P1 — Behavior fixes / sharp edges

- **[Issue #341](https://github.com/hgourvest/node-firebird/issues/341) — RETURNING failure leads to uncaught error** ✅ Resolved
  Goal: isolate statement failures and reset connection state correctly after errors.
  Deliverables:
  - Root cause fixed in `src/wire/connection.ts`: a failing `INSERT ... RETURNING` (`op_execute2`) left the trailing `op_response` of the empty `op_sql_response` unconsumed, shifting every later response to the wrong callback; the error is now consumed and delivered to the statement's callback (with `gdscode`/`gdsparams`), and the transaction/connection stay usable.
  - Also fixed: stale per-packet fetch decode state leaking between responses that share a TCP segment (could desync pipelined statements the same way).
  - Regression test added: `test/returning-failure.js` (failure + subsequent query on the same transaction, connection, pipelined mix, zero-row `UPDATE ... RETURNING`).

- **[Issue #312](https://github.com/hgourvest/node-firebird/issues/312) — Hang when preparing a statement with too many parameters on Firebird 2.5** ✅ Resolved
  Root cause (diagnosed by the reporter): Firebird 2.5 sign-extends XDR opaque lengths above 32767 (a 32768-byte describe response arrives with length `0xFFFF8000`), which corrupted the read position and left the prepare callback hanging. `XdrReader.readArray` now recovers the real length from the low 16 bits when the length is negative — valid positive lengths (including > 65535 on newer servers) are untouched, so the recovery only triggers on the 2.5 bug pattern. Unit test in `test/unit/serialize.test.ts`.

- **[Issue #329](https://github.com/hgourvest/node-firebird/issues/329) — Pool idle connection deletion**
  Goal: make pool idle cleanup safe and observable.
  Deliverables:
  - Document and/or fix idle cleanup behavior.
  - Add observable events/metrics: "connection closed due to idle timeout", etc.

- **[Issue #164](https://github.com/hgourvest/node-firebird/issues/164) — Insert data with charset `NONE` (or `ISO8859_1`)** ✅ Resolved
  Goal: allow binary-safe writes to non-UTF8 text columns without corrupting bytes on the way through Node's string layer.
  Deliverables:
  - Added `SQLParamBuffer` (`src/wire/xsqlvar.ts`) + `XdrWriter.addParamBuffer` (`src/wire/serialize.ts`): when a `Buffer` is passed as a parameter for a non-BLOB column, its raw bytes are written directly instead of being coerced through `Buffer#toString()` (which previously forced a UTF-8 decode and could corrupt data on `NONE`/`WIN1252`/`ISO8859_1` connections).
  - Regression test added: `test/index.js` — "should insert with string from buffer".
  - This is the direct fix for the workaround requested in [#336](https://github.com/hgourvest/node-firebird/issues/336) ("write the buffer directly to the database without any other transliteration") — combine with `encoding: 'NONE'` to pass already-encoded bytes straight through.

### P2 — Questions / documentation gaps (triage)

These may be closed with a clear explanation or resolved with a small doc/code fix.

- **[Issue #353](https://github.com/hgourvest/node-firebird/issues/353)** — LIST() function support question ✅ Resolved (closed upstream via `blobAsText`); now documented in [README.md § FAQ](README.md#faq)
- **[Issue #348](https://github.com/hgourvest/node-firebird/issues/348)** — Protocol version hard-coded? ✅ Resolved (protocol negotiation shipped since the issue was filed); now documented in [README.md § FAQ](README.md#faq)
- **[Issue #335](https://github.com/hgourvest/node-firebird/issues/335)** — BLOB loading slowly ⚠️ Open upstream, but the fix (`blobChunkSize`/`blobReadChunkSize`) already ships — documented in [README.md § FAQ](README.md#faq)
- **[Issue #336](https://github.com/hgourvest/node-firebird/issues/336)** — Default encoding option (UTF-8 vs latin1) ✅ Resolved (`options.encoding` ships); now documented in [README.md § FAQ](README.md#faq), including the transliteration-mismatch caveat raised in the issue thread
- **[Issue #332](https://github.com/hgourvest/node-firebird/issues/332)** — LIKE clause error in SELECT ⚠️ Open upstream (server-side DSQL behavior, not reproducible on Firebird 6.0); workaround documented in [README.md § FAQ](README.md#faq)
- **[Issue #320](https://github.com/hgourvest/node-firebird/issues/320)** — Deno compatibility ✅ Resolved
- **[Issue #322](https://github.com/hgourvest/node-firebird/issues/322)** — `sum()` on NUMERIC columns errored (workaround was CAST) ✅ Resolved — not reproducible on 2.x (fixed by the native-BigInt scaled INT64 decoding); regression test added (`test/index.js` — "should sum NUMERIC columns exactly")
- **[Issue #347](https://github.com/hgourvest/node-firebird/issues/347)** — Sporadic gdscode 335544472 (wrong user/password) on attach ✅ Resolved — matches the SRP proof serialization bug fixed in 2.8.1 (issue #421, ~1.2% of Srp attaches); the reporter's `Legacy_UserManager` workaround bypassed the SRP path. FAQ entry added in [README.md § FAQ](README.md#faq)

---

## 2. Express.js Support (First-Class Integration)

The library already works with Express, but "support" should mean **documented, safe-by-default patterns** that prevent connection leaks and hangs in a request/response lifecycle.

### Deliverables

- **New docs section: "Using node-firebird with Express.js"** ✅ Added — see [README.md](README.md#using-node-firebird-with-expressjs)
  - Recommended architecture: create a single pool at app startup and reuse it. ✅
  - Request lifecycle pattern: acquire connection → run queries → always release in `finally`. ✅ (via an idempotent `withConnection` helper, since callback code has no native `finally`)
  - Transaction middleware example (commit on success, rollback on error). ✅
  - Error handling: map Firebird errors to HTTP status codes without exposing internals. ✅ (using the existing `GDSCode` constants from `src/gdscodes.ts`, published as `node-firebird/lib/gdscodes`)
  - BLOB streaming example: stream BLOBs directly to `res` and ensure `db.detach()` on `finish`/`close`. ✅

- **Optional helper utilities (non-breaking additions)** ✅ Implemented (shipped with the promise API):
  - `pool.withConnection(async (db) => { ... })` — guarantees release even on error.
  - `db.withTransaction(async (tx) => { ... })` — auto-commit or auto-rollback.

### Acceptance Criteria

Provide at least **two copy-paste ready examples**:

1. **Standard JSON API endpoint** — query rows and return JSON, with proper connection release. ✅
2. **BLOB streaming download endpoint** — pipe a BLOB column to the HTTP response, with cleanup on client disconnect. ✅

---

## 3. TypeScript Status & Roadmap

**The migration itself is done.** As of v2.4.0 ([PR #420](https://github.com/hgourvest/node-firebird/pull/420)) the driver is written in TypeScript: `src/` is compiled to `lib/` (CommonJS + generated `.d.ts`) by the native TypeScript 7 compiler, and the prototype-based code was rewritten as ES classes along the way. The runtime API is unchanged — existing JavaScript/callback users are unaffected. Build and development requirements are documented in [README.md § Developing the driver](README.md#developing-the-driver).

### Phase A — Accurate typings for the current API ✅ Done

Superseded by the migration: the hand-maintained `.d.ts` files are gone. Declarations are now generated from the sources at build time (`src/types.ts` and friends), so they cover connection options, the pool, database/transaction/statement objects, driver events and result shapes — and they cannot drift from the implementation.

**Remaining caveats (inherent, not migration debt):**
- Query result shapes are dynamic (depend on the SQL); TypeScript cannot infer column names automatically. Users must cast or supply their own row types.
- Blob columns being functions is a runtime quirk; the typings are accurate but may surprise users new to the library.
- Some options and event payloads vary by server version or protocol; typings stay permissive in those areas to avoid false type errors.

### Phase A.1 — Strictness hardening ✅ Done

The sources now compile with full `"strict": true` (including `noImplicitAny`, `strictNullChecks`, `strictPropertyInitialization`, `useUnknownInCatchVariables`). The hardening was done without runtime changes: wire-populated fields use definite-assignment assertions, connection/service handles use non-null assertions at send sites, and the intentionally dynamic wire-core parameters carry explicit `: any` annotations — making the remaining looseness visible and greppable (`grep ': any' src/wire`) for the follow-up tightening below.

**Follow-up (Phase A.2, future):** replace the explicit `: any` annotations in `src/wire/connection.ts` with real types (Statement/Transaction/Callback shapes), which is a semantic typing effort rather than a compiler-flag one.

### Phase B — Dual API: callbacks + promises ✅ Done

Shipped: every callback API has a promise-returning `*Async` counterpart (`Firebird.attachAsync`, `pool.getAsync`, `db.queryAsync`, `db.executeAsync`, `transaction.commitAsync`, `transaction.rollbackAsync`, statement wrappers, …) plus the `pool.withConnection()` and `db.withTransaction()` helpers. The wrappers delegate to the callback implementations, so execution ordering and serialization semantics are unchanged, and rejections are always `Error` instances carrying `gdscode`/`gdsparams`. Documented in [README.md § Promises and async/await](README.md#promises-and-asyncawait).

**Remaining awareness points (documented, inherent to promises):**
- Promise wrappers can hide resource-leak bugs if callers forget `finally`; the `withConnection` / `withTransaction` helpers mitigate this.
- Mixing callbacks and promises in the same codebase increases the surface for subtle bugs; the docs recommend one style per project.
- Rejected promises that are not caught produce `UnhandledPromiseRejection` warnings — a difference from callback-style errors.

**Follow-up:** ✅ Done — the ServiceManager API (backup/restore/user management/trace/properties) now has `*Async` wrappers for every function, documented in [README.md § Service Manager functions](README.md#service-manager-functions).

### Phase C — Modern TypeScript ergonomics (optional / future)

- Consider publishing dual CJS + ESM package exports, or documenting CJS-only stance clearly.
- Add opt-in generic helpers:
  - `db.query<T = Record<string, unknown>>(sql, params)` for user-supplied row shapes.
  - `db.queryAsync<T>(...): Promise<T[]>`

**Constraints:**
- Full ESM migration can be a **breaking change** depending on consumer build tooling; it may require a major version bump and a migration guide.
- Generic row typing is only as good as the types the user supplies; it does not validate SQL at compile time.

### Modern JavaScript Classes ✅ Done

Shipped as part of the TypeScript migration (v2.4.0): the prototype-based codebase now uses ES `class` syntax throughout `src/`.

## 4. Protocol Implementation Status

| Firebird Version | Protocol Versions | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2.5 | 10, 11, 12, 13 | ✅ Implemented |
| 3.0 | 14, 15 | ✅ Implemented |
| 4.0 | 16, 17 | ✅ Implemented |
| 5.0 | 18, 19 | ✅ Implemented |
| 6.0 | 20 | ✅ Implemented |

### Firebird 3 Support

- **Protocol Versions 14 and 15:** ✅ Implemented.
- **Enhanced Authentication:** ✅ Implemented — Srp256 (SHA-256) alongside Srp (SHA-1) and Legacy_Auth.
- **Wire Protocol Encryption:** ✅ Implemented — Arc4 (RC4) stream cipher using SRP session keys.
- **Wire Protocol Compression:** ✅ Implemented — zlib compression for protocol 13+.
- **Packed (NULL-aware) Row Data:** ✅ Implemented — null bitmap for protocol 13+.
- **op_cond_accept Handling:** ✅ Implemented.
- **UTF-8 User Identification:** ✅ Implemented.
- **Database Encryption Callback:** ✅ Implemented — `op_crypt_key_callback` support; `dbCryptConfig` accepts plain text or base64-encoded keys.

### Firebird 4 Support

- **Protocol Versions 16 and 17:** ✅ Implemented.
- **Statement Timeout:** ✅ Implemented (Protocol 16+).
- **`INT128` Data Type:** ✅ Implemented.
- **Time Zone Support:** ✅ Implemented — `TIME WITH TIME ZONE`, `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`, `sessionTimeZone` option (Protocol 16+).
- **`DECFLOAT` Data Type:** ✅ Implemented — `DECFLOAT(16)` and `DECFLOAT(34)` with full IEEE 754-2008 BID (Binary Integer Decimal) encoding/decoding.

### Firebird 5 Support

- **Protocol Version 18:** ✅ Implemented.
- **Bidirectional Cursors:** ✅ Implemented — scrollable cursors for remote database access.
- **`RETURNING` Multiple Rows:** ✅ Implemented — DML returning multiple rows.
- **`SKIP LOCKED`:** ✅ Implemented — `SELECT WITH LOCK`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` (pure SQL syntax compatibility).
- **Parallel Workers:** ✅ Implemented — client connection configuration via `parallelWorkers` (`isc_dpb_parallel_workers` DPB tag).
- **Protocol Version 19 (Inline BLOBs):** ✅ Implemented — support for `op_inline_blob` (114) packet decoding/caching, and `maxInlineBlobSize` (`isc_dpb_max_inline_blob_size` DPB tag `93`) connection parameter.

### Firebird 6 and Beyond

- **Protocol Version 20:** ✅ Implemented — the Protocol 20 "prepare hang" was root-caused (the server reads a trailing `p_sqlst_flags` field from `op_prepare_statement` since `PROTOCOL_PREPARE_FLAG`/protocol 20; the client did not send it, leaving the server blocked mid-packet) and fixed: the field is now sent, Protocol 20 is offered by default, and schema metadata (`relationSchema` via `isc_info_sql_relation_schema`) is returned on describe. `maxNegotiatedProtocols` remains as an escape hatch — the offered list is capped oldest-first, so `10` stops at Protocol 19 (the previous behavior). Integration tests in `test/protocol20.js`.
- **Srp384 and Srp512 Authentication Plugins:** ✅ Implemented — support for the SHA-384 and SHA-512 based Secure Remote Password (SRP) authentication plugins, dynamically upgraded during the connection handshake.
- **ChaCha and ChaCha64 Wire Encryption:** ✅ Implemented — support for the `ChaCha` and `ChaCha64` symmetric encryption algorithms in the wire protocol (incorporating SHA-256 session key stretching and IV mapping), providing a modern, secure alternative to the deprecated `Arc4` (RC4) cipher.
- **Creation with Different Owner (Issue #7718):** ✅ Implemented — `options.owner` sends `isc_dpb_owner` (102) on database creation, letting a superuser create a database owned by another user. Landed together with a DPB-tag correctness fix: `parallelWorkers`, `maxInlineBlobSize`, `searchPath` and `defaultSchema` were serialised with the WRONG tags (92–95 are the Firebird 4 replica/bind/decfloat tags — `parallelWorkers` silently switched the database into replica mode, `searchPath` failed the attach). The real values are 100/104/105; `defaultSchema` (which has no DPB tag of its own) is implemented by putting the schema first in the search path, since `CURRENT_SCHEMA` is the first existing schema of it. `isc_arg_warning` status-vector entries (e.g. "parallel workers value capped") are now parsed instead of hanging the connection. Live tests in `test/dpb-options.js`.

## 6. Feature Parity with Other Node.js SQL Drivers (pg, mysql2, Postgres.js)

A review of what [node-postgres (`pg`)](https://node-postgres.com/), [`mysql2`](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2) and [Postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) offer, compared against what this driver already ships. The goal is not to copy every feature, but to adopt the idioms Node.js developers now expect from a database driver.

### Already at parity (no work needed)

- **Row streaming with backpressure** — `sequentially()` with the `(row, index, next)` / Promise form covers what `pg-cursor` / `mysql2`'s `.stream()` provide (a `Readable` wrapper is still proposed below for ecosystem interop).
- **Server push notifications** — Firebird `POST_EVENT` support is the counterpart of PostgreSQL `LISTEN/NOTIFY`.
- **Object and array row formats** — `db.query` (objects) / `db.execute` (arrays) match `rowMode: 'array'` (pg) and `rowsAsArray` (mysql2).
- **Wire compression** — shipped (mysql2 has it; pg does not).
- **Authentication plugins** — Srp/Srp256/384/512 + Legacy, negotiated automatically (mysql2's auth-switch equivalent).
- **Statement timeouts** — shipped for FB 4.0+.
- **BigInt-safe numerics** — native `BigInt` for `INT128`, full IEEE 754 `DECFLOAT` (ahead of both drivers here).
- **Prepared statements** — available via `newStatement()` (manual reuse; transparent reuse via the `statementCacheSize` LRU cache).

### Not applicable to Firebird

- **SSL/TLS transport** — Firebird uses its own wire encryption (Arc4/ChaCha/ChaCha64 via SRP session keys), already shipped; TLS is not part of the Firebird remote protocol.
- **Multiple statements per query string** (mysql2 `multipleStatements`) — not supported by Firebird DSQL; `EXECUTE BLOCK` already covers the use case server-side.

### Gaps worth implementing

Ordered roughly by expected user impact:

1. **Promise/`async`–`await` API** ✅ Implemented — `*Async` wrappers on every API plus `pool.withConnection()` / `db.withTransaction()` helpers ([TypeScript Phase B](#phase-b--dual-api-callbacks--promises--done)), including ServiceManager `*Async` wrappers.
2. **Query cancellation + `AbortSignal`** ✅ Implemented — `{ signal }` in query options (callback and promise APIs, database- and transaction-level) plus manual `db.cancel()` / `db.cancelAsync()`, built on out-of-band `op_cancel` (protocol 12+). Cancelled statements fail with `err.gdscode === GDSCode.CANCELLED`; already-aborted signals reject with `AbortError` without contacting the server. Documented in [README.md § Query Cancellation with AbortSignal](README.md#query-cancellation-with-abortsignal-firebird-25).
3. **Batch/bulk execution (Firebird 4 batch API)** ✅ Implemented — `executeBatch` / `executeBatchAsync` on database (all-or-nothing), transaction (partial success with per-record errors) and statement objects, built on protocol 16 `op_batch_create` / `op_batch_msg` / `op_batch_exec`. Metadata-exact encoding (NUMERIC scale, BigInt, BOOLEAN, TIMESTAMP, DECFLOAT), NULL bitmaps, chunked messages, `multiError` completion state. Neither pg nor mysql2 has protocol-level batching. BLOB/ARRAY batch parameters remain a follow-up. Documented in [README.md § Batch Execution](README.md#batch-execution-firebird-40).
4. **Pool observability and tuning** ✅ Implemented — the pool is now an `EventEmitter` (`connect`, `acquire`, `release`, `remove`, plus an opt-in `error` channel) with live metrics (`totalCount`, `idleCount`, `activeCount`, `waitingCount`) and idle lifecycle tuning: `idleTimeoutMillis` shrinks the pool down to `min` when traffic drops and the same sweep evicts dead idle connections. Resolves [#329](https://github.com/hgourvest/node-firebird/issues/329) (idle connections held forever) and [#343](https://github.com/hgourvest/node-firebird/issues/343) (dead pooled connections handed to callers). Documented in [README.md § Pool events and metrics](README.md#pool-events-and-metrics).
5. **Connection URI strings** ✅ Implemented — `firebird://user:password@host:3050/path/to/db.fdb?encoding=UTF8` accepted everywhere an options object is (attach/create/attachOrCreate/drop/pool and the `*Async` wrappers), with alias vs absolute-path vs Windows-path handling, percent-decoding, typed query-parameter coercion and an exported `parseConnectionUri`. Documented in [README.md § Connection URI strings](README.md#connection-uri-strings).
6. **Named placeholders** ✅ Implemented (2.9.0) — mysql2's `namedPlaceholders: true` (`SELECT * FROM t WHERE id = :id` with `{id: 1}`), rewritten client-side to positional `?` params. Documented in [README.md § Named placeholders](README.md#named-placeholders).
7. **Custom type parsers (`typeCast`)** ✅ Implemented — mysql2-style `typeCast(column, next)` connection option, called for every result column value (including NULLs) with full column metadata (`type`/`typeName`/`subType`/`scale`/`field`/`relation`/`alias`) and `next()` returning the default-decoded value (after `blobAsText`/`jsonAsObject`). Covers the row decode path and `blobAsText`-resolved text; SQL type codes exported as `Firebird.SQL_TYPES`. Subsumes future per-type flag requests (dates as strings, BIGINT as string, etc.). Documented in [README.md § Custom type parsers](README.md#custom-type-parsers-typecast).
8. **Prepared-statement cache** ✅ Implemented — `statementCacheSize` option: a per-connection LRU cache of **idle** prepared statements, transparently reused by `db.query`/`tx.query`/`sequentially`/`executeBatch` with no API changes. Statements leave the cache while in use (concurrent runs of the same SQL never share a cursor), failed statements and DDL are never cached, and LRU entries are dropped over the limit. The legacy `cacheQuery`/`maxCachedQuery` options map onto the same cache (now bounded). Documented in [README.md § Prepared-statement cache](README.md#prepared-statement-cache).
9. **`Readable` stream adapter** ✅ Implemented — `db.queryStream(sql, params, options)` / `transaction.queryStream(...)` returning an object-mode `Readable` built on `sequentially`'s `next()`-based backpressure (fetching pauses while the buffer is full). Early destroy — including a `pipeline()` teardown — aborts the fetch and releases the statement. Composes with `typeCast`/`blobAsText`/`jsonAsObject`. Documented in [README.md § Streaming rows with queryStream](README.md#streaming-rows-with-querystream).
10. **Configurable socket keepalive** ✅ Implemented — `enableKeepAlive` (default true) and `keepAliveInitialDelay` (default 60000 ms) connection options, same names as mysql2, also accepted as URI query parameters. Documented in [README.md § Connection options](README.md#connection-options).
11. **`nestTables` / duplicate-column handling** ✅ Implemented — mysql2's `nestTables` as a connection and per-query option: `true` nests each object row by source table (`row[table][column]`, self-joins nest under their query aliases via `isc_info_sql_relation_alias`, expression columns under `''`), a string separator flattens to `'table<sep>column'` keys. Composes with `typeCast`/`blobAsText`/`queryStream`/`lowercase_keys`; array rows unaffected. The shared key computation also fixed a latent `sequentially` bug: blob materialization aligned `Object.keys(row)` with the column metadata by index, which desyncs on duplicate JOIN column names. Documented in [README.md § Nested result tables](README.md#nested-result-tables-nesttables); tests in `test/nest-tables.js`.
12. **Multi-host pooling (`PoolCluster`)** — mysql2 routes across primaries/replicas with failover strategies. With Firebird 4+ logical replication this becomes relevant, but it is niche today — evaluate after pool observability lands. (Postgres.js's `target_session_attrs` multi-host support is the same idea; still deferred for lack of demand.)

### Round 2 (July 2026): review vs node-postgres (`pg` 8.16) and [Postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres)

With items 1–11 above shipped, a second comparison pass against the current PostgreSQL drivers (`pg` 8.12–8.16 added per-query timeouts, ESM exports, SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS, pool `min`/`maxUses`; Postgres.js is the ergonomics benchmark: tagged templates, savepoints, cursors, COPY streams, env-var config).

**Confirmed at parity** (no work needed): promise API + `withConnection`/`withTransaction` (pg `pool.query`, Postgres.js `sql.begin`); per-query timeouts (`timeout`, FB 4+ server-side — pg 8.13's per-query timeout is client-side only); query cancellation (`AbortSignal` / out-of-band `op_cancel`; Postgres.js cancels mid-execution the same way); cursors with backpressure (`sequentially` / `queryStream` ≈ Postgres.js `.cursor()`/`.forEach()`); connection reservation (`pool.get` ≈ `sql.reserve()`); pool `min` + idle reaping (pg 8.16 `min`, Postgres.js `idle_timeout`); pipelining (the protocol queue pipelines by design; deliberate per-query batching like Postgres.js's is possible today by issuing queries without awaiting); array-row mode (`execute` ≈ `.values()`); automatic prepared-statement reuse (`statementCacheSize` ≈ Postgres.js auto-prepare); LISTEN/NOTIFY counterpart (POST_EVENT); BigInt numerics; generic row typing on the promise API (`queryAsync<T>`).

**Not applicable to Firebird**: SSL/TLS + SCRAM channel binding (Firebird uses SRP + Arc4/ChaCha wire crypt); `queryMode` simple-vs-extended protocol switch (no such split in the Firebird protocol); logical-replication client subscription (Postgres.js `.subscribe()` — Firebird replication is server-to-server, not exposed to wire clients); multiple statements per query string (unchanged from Round 1).

**Gaps worth implementing** (continuing the numbering, ordered by expected impact):

13. **Affected-rows count + result metadata in the promise API** ✅ Implemented — per-query `withMeta: true` (callback and promise APIs) delivers `{ rows, fields, affectedRows, recordCounts, warnings }` without touching the bare-rows default. For DML — including `RETURNING` and `EXECUTE PROCEDURE` — `affectedRows` is the server-reported count (`isc_info_sql_records` via a new `op_info_sql` request, issued while the statement handle is still open) with per-verb `recordCounts`; for SELECT it is `rows.length` (pg's `rowCount` convention, no extra round-trip). `fields` reuses the typeCast column vocabulary plus nullability and relation alias/schema; TypeScript overloads resolve `queryAsync<T>(…, { withMeta: true })` to `QueryResult<T>`. Documented in [README.md § Result metadata and affected rows](README.md#result-metadata-and-affected-rows-withmeta); tests in `test/query-meta.js`.
14. **Tagged-template query API** ✅ Implemented — `db.sql` / `tx.sql` (Postgres.js style): interpolations compile to positional `?` params client-side (injection-safe by construction), queries are lazy thenables executing exactly once on await, embedded queries compose as fragments (text + params spliced in place), `sql('NAME')` produces safely quoted dot-qualified identifiers, arrays expand to `?, ?, ?` lists for `IN`, and `.options()` / `.withMeta()` / `.toQuery()` tie into the existing per-query options, the #13 result shape, and testing/logging. Pure client-side sugar in `src/sql-template.ts` over `queryAsync` — the callback API is untouched. Documented in [README.md § Tagged-template queries](README.md#tagged-template-queries-sql); tests in `test/sql-template.js` + `test/unit/sql-template.test.ts`. (Insert-from-object builders deferred until asked for.)
15. **Surface server warnings** ✅ Implemented — every `isc_arg_warning` on a successful response is now emitted as a `warning` driver event (`{ gdscode, params, message }`, message resolved via firebird.msg with a gdscode+params fallback for codes newer than the bundled file) and included in `withMeta` results. Emission is deferred one tick so a listener registered inside the attach callback still catches attach-time warnings (e.g. "parallel workers value capped"). Documented in [README.md § Driver Events](README.md#driver-events); test in `test/query-meta.js`.
16. **Savepoint helpers** ✅ Implemented — `transaction.savepoint(work)`: SAVEPOINT on entry, RELEASE on resolve, ROLLBACK TO on reject (undoing only work's changes, transaction stays usable, original error rethrown with any rollback failure attached as `err.savepointRollbackError`). Nestable via generated names, mirroring `withTransaction` / Postgres.js `sql.savepoint()`. Documented in [README.md § Savepoints](README.md#savepoints); live tests in `test/savepoints.js`.
17. **Environment-variable configuration defaults** ✅ Implemented — `normalizeOptions` (the single entry point for attach/create/pool/URI strings) falls back to `ISC_USER` / `ISC_PASSWORD` (Firebird's own isql conventions) plus `FIREBIRD_HOST` / `FIREBIRD_PORT` / `FIREBIRD_DATABASE` / `FIREBIRD_ROLE` for settings the caller omitted. Explicit options always win, built-in defaults apply last, caller-owned option objects are never mutated. Documented in [README.md § Connection options](README.md#connection-options); unit tests in `test/unit/env-defaults.test.ts`.
18. **Pool connection recycling** ✅ Implemented — `maxUses` (pg) retires a physical connection after N checkouts, `maxLifetimeMillis` (Postgres.js `max_lifetime`) T ms after creation. Enforced when the connection returns to the pool, and the idle sweep also retires over-lifetime idle connections (even below `min` — recycling is the point; replacements are created on demand). Both default off. Documented in [README.md § Pool events and metrics](README.md#pool-events-and-metrics); live tests in `test/pool-recycling.js`.
19. **Row-key transforms** ✅ Implemented — `transformKeys` (connection-level and per-query): the built-in `'camel'` (`FIRST_NAME` → `firstName`) or a custom `(key) => key` mapper, applied in `computeColumnKeys` after `lowercase_keys` and to both parts of `nestTables` keys, so the decoder and the blob resolver stay in agreement. Custom mappers are guarded like typeCast (a throw falls back to the untransformed key instead of desyncing the decode loop). Column metadata keeps raw aliases. Documented in [README.md § Transforming row keys](README.md#transforming-row-keys-transformkeys); live tests in `test/transform-keys.js`.
20. **Bulk-insert Writable stream** — the COPY FROM analogue: a `db.batchStream(sql)` object-mode Writable that chunks rows through the Firebird 4 batch API (item 3). Useful for piping ETL sources; BLOB/ARRAY batch params remain the prerequisite follow-up.

ESM/CJS dual exports (pg ships both since 8.15) and callback-API generics stay under [TypeScript Phase C](#phase-c--modern-typescript-ergonomics-optional--future) — the ESM half is the next-major headline item.
